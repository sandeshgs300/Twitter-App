# Jive Purposeful Places SDK - Master Reference Document

Welcome! In this series of documents, you will learn how to integrate into the Jive Purposeful Places framework. You will get a firm understanding of how the framework works within Jive, the new concepts of tiles, and how to leverage the jive-sdk to build your own integrations.

The [Readme](../Readme.md) doc is a great place to get started. Hopefully, you've walked through that and have your first tile up and running. Now, let's dig a bit more into the "ins & outs" of Purposeful Places, Tiles, and integrating with Jive.

> This document is a work in progress! We'll be building it out over time so make sure you watch the repository for any updates.
